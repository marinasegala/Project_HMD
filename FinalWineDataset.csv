1,La Gioiosa Prosecco DOC,"In Treviso, Prosecco’s heartland, the locals have a motto to describe their home – ‘marca gioiosa et amorosa’, it’s a ‘joyful and loving’ place. It inspired the Moretti Polegato family when they needed a name for their wine business. They’ve been making Prosecco for three generations and wanted a name that tied them to the land which had given them so much. ‘Gioiosa’ – ‘joyful’ was the perfect fit. These lively bubbles are wonderfully refreshing with notes of white blossom, pear and peachy stone fruit. The perfect aperitif or party wine – and delicious with canapés. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award.",Prosecco,15.75,75CL,Glera,,Natural Cork,Italy,"Green Apple, Citrus Fruit, Floral",White,11.00%,Veneto,Light & Refreshing,NV,"aperitif, white meat, fish, dessert"
2,La Gioiosa Prosecco Valdobbiadene DOCG,"The Moretti Polegato family have been making Prosecco for three generations. And this is their cream-of-the-crop fizz. Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG is Prosecco's version of a Grand Cru. These rolling hills are where you'll find the very best of the region’s sparkling wine. So if you're going to pick just one bottle, make it this. Expect a soft, creamy mousse with elegant notes of apple, stone fruit and blossom.

3,Beato Bartolomeo Pinot Grigio Superiore DOC,"Pinot Grigio’s heartland is in Veneto, northeast Italy. It’s where you’ll find Breganze DOC, a tiny region in the Alpine foothills which is known for prioritising quality above all else. In fact, it’s so small that the region’s growers have formed a single cooperative – Beato Bartolomeo Breganze. If Pinot Grigio is a must for your wine rack, then this one is a first-rate choice. Fresh and light, with crisp citrus flavours and floral aromas, this is Pinot Grigio at its most refreshing. Fantastic as an aperitif, but also with green salads and light fish dishes.",Pinot,12.1,75CL,Pinot Grigio,,Screwcap,Italy,"Lime, Floral, Lemon",White,12.50%,Veneto,Smooth & Light,2022,"aperitif, white meat, soup, risotto"

This beautiful landscape sets the scene for the Rossi Cairo family’s biodynamic winemaking, which brings purity to all of their wines. Their Gavi embodies this. A zingy blend of fruit and freshness with notes of peach, almond and blossom.

5,"La Marca Extra Dry Prosecco, Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG","This is Prosecco – but better. Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG is like Prosecco’s ‘Grand Cru’, and in these hills it’s impossible to cut corners. The vineyards are incredibly steep, so much so that everything has to be done by hand – often with the help of a harness. It’s truly extreme winemaking. But it’s worth it to make fizz this good. Fresh. Floral. Fruity. It has a soft, creamy mousse, with full flavours of ripe white peach, apple and citrus. It’s not bone dry so it’s a great choice as an aperitif.","Prosecco, Valdobbiadene",18.18,75CL,Glera,,Natural Cork,Italy,"Pear, Citrus Fruit, Floral, Green Apple",White,11.00%,Veneto,Crisp & Fruity,2021,aperitif

Its rich, volcanic soils, high-altitude vines and distinct temperature variations encourage a mineral, elegant style of wine. This bottle has been crafted by one of Italy's most dynamic and talented winemakers, Alessandro Michelon. So you can expect excellence. It’s perfumed, tropical and refreshing – expect hints of mango, pear and fresh herbs.

7,"Beato Bartolomeo ‘Naturae' Vespaiolo , Breganze DOC","Grapes have been grown in Breganze DOC for more than 1,000 years. The tiny appellation lies in the foothills of the Italian Alps, and it’s here that the Beato Bartolomeo cooperative was founded back in 1950. Today, they set the standard for the region's wines. And this crisp white is a case in point. It’s made from Vespaiolo, a grape variety that’s famously used to make sweet wines – and as you’ll see in this, it makes delicious dry styles too. It’s fresh and zesty with notes of lemon and grapefruit, plus a touch of honey. The citrusy flavours make it an ideal match for fish and seafood. If you love Sauvignon Blanc but want to try something a little different, this is the wine for you.",,14.5,75CL,Vespaiola,,Screwcap,Italy,"Grapefruit, Honey, Lemon",White,12.00%,Veneto,Crisp & Zesty,2022,"Codfish, delicate dishes"

Now in their fourth generation of family ownership, they have over 140 years of expertise behind them. Their roots lie in Tuscany – and today they’re considered one of the region’s leading wineries. This aromatic white blend combines two traditional Tuscan grape varieties, Vermentino and Malvasia. It spends seven weeks maturing in special clay amphorae, which gives it an elegant texture while still allowing the fruit flavours to take centre stage.

9,Definition Gavi di Gavi DOCG,"The Definition range brings the world's greatest wine styles to Majestic customers. We tasked our buyers with finding the definition of Gavi di Gavi. They searched the hillside vineyards of Piedmont, a prestigious area where the landscape is dominated by the majestic Alps. This wine comes from the vineyards within the town of Gavi itself, where the Cortese grape ripens slowly thanks to the altitude and cool sea breezes. It’s a fresh, citrusy, food-friendly wine with flavours of ripe apple, lemon peel and a hint of almond with a long concentrated finish. It’s renowned for its ability to pair with food and its crisp flavours work brilliantly with seafood risotto.",Gavi,18.18,75CL,Cortese,,Screwcap,Italy,"Green Apple, Herbaceous, Pear",White,12.50%,Piedmont,Fresh & Elegant ,2022,fish
10,La Toledana Gavi di Gavi DOCG,"Gian Battista Cambiaso planted the very first Cortese vines in Gavi 400 years ago. The dry white wine he produced was the first recorded in the region, and his Castello La Toledana is one of the very few Genoese noble houses still standing today. Bordering the coastal region of Liguria, their Cortese grapes are cooled by sea breezes and develop mouth-watering flavours. Gavi is often called the ‘Chablis of Italy’, and we can see why. Crisp. Fresh. Citrusy. It’s deliciously refreshing and aromatic, with hints of white peach and honey. Unsurprisingly, given where it’s from, Gavi is fantastic with pesto and vegetable dishes.",Gavi,19.4,75CL,Cortese,,Natural Cork,Italy,"Lime, Citrus Fruit, Floral, Green Apple, Lemon",White,13.00%,Piedmont,Aromatic & Floral,2021,"aperitif, first course"
11,Louis Latour Mâcon-Lugny,"We’ve sold this wine for thirty years – and for that whole time it’s been a bestseller. Why’s it so popular? White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn’t have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It’s proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old favourites.",Macon,21.8,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,France,"Peach, Apricot, Floral, Lemon",White,13.50%,Burgundy,Ripe & Rounded,2022,"aperitif, fish, cheese"
12,Louis Roederer 'Cristal' Champagne,"Cristal is Louis Roederer’s flagship wine. It was first made in 1876, when Tsar Alexander II asked the house to reserve their best cuvee for him every year. But he had another request. Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a ‘punt’, in the bottom. And an icon was born. It’s made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.",Champagne ,363.0,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,France,"Lemon, Orange, White flowers, Roasted nuts",White,12.00%,Champagne,Aromatic & Floral,2015,fish
13,Bouvet Ladubay Saumur Brut,"The Loire Valley’s Saumur Brut is the go-to appellation if you like premium sparkling wine – but not the high price tag. And this one is hands down our most popular bottle. Over its rich history, Bouvet Ladubay has been endorsed by Napoleon III and chosen as official supplier to the House of Lords. They specialise in bringing out the floral notes of Chenin Blanc, and it certainly shows in this lively, zesty fizz. Expect notes of honeysuckle, apple and lime, with a crisp, fresh finish.

14,Moët & Chandon 'Brut Impérial' Champagne,"Moët is the ultimate celebratory fizz. The house is credited with inventing the Champagne glass pyramid. The victorious ‘spray’ of Champagne familiar to sport podiums is also down to them. But not only does their famous label put you in a party mood – it’s also a fantastic wine. It’s crisp and refreshing, but rich and ripe and full of stone fruit flavours. Think peach and lemon zest. With aromas of biscuit and brioche, it’s as decadent as it is moreish. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award.",Champagne ,56.99,75CL,Chardonnay,"Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier",Natural Cork,France,"Citrus Fruit, Biscuit, Bread",White,12.00%,Champagne,Crisp & Fruity,NV,fish
15,Taittinger Brut Réserve Champagne,"The first time Pierre Taittinger visited Champagne was as an injured officer during WWI. He promised himself that he would return and buy an estate for his family. In 1932 he did just that. The sale included some of the original vineyards which had been planted by Benedictine monks in the 1730s. And the rest is history. This is a classic Champagne, full of honeysuckle, brioche and pear flavours. Taittinger was Bond’s Champagne of choice in the original novels, so try it with something equally sophisticated. We suggest cheese gougères, fresh from the oven.",Champagne ,55.7,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,France,"Peach, Green Apple, Lemon, Walnut",White,12.50%,Champagne,Crisp & Fruity,NV,"aperitif, fish"
16,Laurent-Perrier 'La Cuvée' Brut Champagne,"Laurent-Perrier began in 1812, but this Champagne house isn't one to stick to traditions. The winemaking team recently tore up the recipe for their non-vintage cuvée. The old wine was already one of the best-selling Champagnes in the world – but they knew they could create something even better. They weren’t wrong. La Cuvée was released in 2017. It's a uniquely fresh fizz made predominantly from Chardonnay – and it remains a popular choice for discerning Champagne fans. It's a superb marriage of white blossom, citrus and peach, with delicate toasty notes and a light mousse.",Champagne ,60.6,75CL,Chardonnay,"Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier",Natural Cork,France,"Green Apple, Biscuit, Bread, Citrus Fruit",White,12.00%,Champagne,Crisp & Fruity,NV,"aperitif, fish, poultry"
17,Heidsieck & Co. Monopole 'Gold Top' Champagne,"Heidsieck & Co. are one of only 24 Grand Marque Champagne houses. You can always rely on these highly esteemed houses for quality, but Heidsieck stands out for combining quality with incredible value. Gold Top is their most decadent cuvée. The wine is aged for up to a decade before it's released, so such a lengthy process results in seriously luxurious bubbles. The long ageing means the rich, toasty, creamy flavours are dialled right up. It’s aromatic and citrusy, with a lush texture and a lingering finish.",Champagne ,41.2,75CL,Chardonnay,Pinot Noir,Natural Cork,France,"Pear, Biscuit, Cream, Green Apple, Lemon, Quince, Red Apple",White,12.50%,Champagne,Rich & Toasty,2018,"fish, mashroom"
18,Cave de Lugny 'Reserve' Mâcon-Chardonnay,"The small village of Mâcon-Chardonnay isn’t coincidentally named. It claims to be the birthplace of Chardonnay and made a name for itself in the 19th century for producing high-quality wines. Cave de Lugny is a true specialist – it’s the biggest Chardonnay producer in Burgundy, but it doesn’t rest on its laurels. They prove that classic white Burgundy doesn’t have to be expensive. The wine is rested on its lees which intensifies the flavours and gives it a delicious creaminess. Discover ripe fruit flavours. Peach. Apricot. Apple. And plenty of citrusy freshness.

19,Chanoine Frères 'Réserve Privée' Brut Champagne,"Chanoine Frères is the second-oldest Champagne house. It was established way back in 1730, so it has spent nearly three centuries perfecting its craft. For the last two decades it has championed diversity in this traditional region, putting winemaker Isabelle Tellier at the helm – one of the first female Chefs de Caves in Champagne. Her 20 years of experience shows in this delicious brut. Made primarily from Pinot Noir grapes, it's well-structured and beautifully aromatic.

20,Lanson 'Le Black Creation' Brut Champagne,"With over 260 years of winemaking history, Lanson is one of the oldest houses in Champagne. Their much-loved signature cuvée, Le Black Label, was created in 1937 in honour of the house’s appointment as the official suppliers of the Royal Court of England. And now, with Le Black Création, winemaker Hervé Dantan has redefined it. Each Création is unique, made with the best grapes from over 100 crus and reserve wines dating back over a decade. And each blend carries its own number – in reference to the number of harvests that have taken place since Maison Lanson was founded in 1760. This, the 257th blend, predominantly uses wine from the 2017 vintage, which produced Chardonnay with marked freshness, intensely fruity Pinot Noir, and notably supple Pinot Meunier. It's then aged for four years before release to dial up the complexity. You’ll find it rich yet elegant with ripe citrus and orchard-fruit flavours, plus notes of brioche and dried fruits.",Champagne ,52.0,75CL,Pinot Noir,"Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay",Natural Cork,France,"Honey, Bread, Citrus Fruit",White,12.50%,Champagne,Crisp & Fruity,NV,fish
21,Beato Bartolomeo ‘Naturae' Pinot Noir,"Pinot Noir isn’t often associated with Italy – but this famously finicky grape variety thrives in the country’s north east. In fact, it’s been grown in the Veneto region for centuries, and is even known locally as Pinot Nero. This exclusive bottling is made by Beato Bartolomeo, a cooperative based in Breganze DOC in the Alpine foothills. They’ve been making high quality wines since 1950, so they know just how to get the best out of their grapes. Cool Alpine influences keep the Pinot Noir’s flavours bright and fresh, so the team leaves the wine unoaked to let those flavours take centre stage.

23,Domini Veneti 'La Casetta' Valpolicella Ripasso DOC Superiore,"This is Valpolicella Ripasso with a difference. Ripasso wines are made by adding the leftover grape skins from Amarone production to standard Valpolicella, giving greater depth of flavour, texture and tannin. But Domini Veneti’s winemakers go a step further to make La Casetta. They re-ferment the wine with skins leftover from making Recioto – an intensely rich dessert wine – which pushes it into another dimension of flavour. Consider this an exceptional value ‘Baby Amarone’. It’s intense and spicy with rich, heady aromas. Expect notes of plum, cherry, chocolate and dried fruits.

24,"Pasqua 'Desire, Lush & Zin' Primitivo","Love big, bold reds? If so, you’ve likely tried Californian Zinfandel or Italian Primitivo. These sibling grapes may be genetically identical, but each has its own distinct character. And this velvety bottling combines the best of both. It’s a classic, earthy Primitivo with a modern twist inspired by the smooth, plush character of Zinfandel. The grapes are macerated in their own juice before fermentation, which dials up the delicious fruity flavour. And six months of oak ageing gives it extra complexity and a silky texture. Discover notes of cherry, plum, coffee and cocoa, plus hints of black pepper and vanilla spice. It’s the perfect partner for rich tomato-based dishes.",,15.75,75CL,Primitivo,,Natural Cork,Italy,"Vanilla, Black Fruit, Black Plum",Red,13.50%,Puglia,Rich & Juicy,2022,"first course, red meat, poultry"
25,Primo Rosso Appassimento,"In the heel of Italy's boot, you’ll find Puglia – the home of Primitivo. But this particular bottling is anything but ordinary for the region. It’s made using the appassimento method, which has been a distinctly northern Italian style of winemaking for centuries. Primo’s winemaker, Alessandro Michelon, was the first outside of Veneto to adopt the method. He realised that Puglia’s sun-drenched, windswept vineyards offer an ideal climate for the process; once grapes are ripe, his team move through the vines, twisting the stem of every other bunch. This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine. Just like a Valpolicella, it’s big, plush and velvety, with ripe flavours of cherry, raspberry and redcurrant. A rich, meaty stew makes the perfect partner to its bold, fruity character.",,14.5,75CL,Primitivo,,Screwcap,Italy,"Vanilla, Black Fruit, Black Plum",Red,14.50%,Puglia,Rich & Juicy,2022,"first course, red meat"

And this is made by Agostina Pieri: a small family winery that consistently provides great value in an otherwise expensive region.

Its highly fertile soils make it a prime spot for agriculture – and it’s here that Torre Mora grow their grapes. They make this wine from two local varieties, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio. Its name, ‘Cauru’, means ‘hot’ in Sicilian – a reference to the heat and energy contained in the volcanic soils. This heat makes for intense, ripe flavours, but the wine is also remarkably fresh thanks to the region’s drastically cooler nighttime temperatures, which help retain the grapes’ natural acidity.

But if you spend just a little extra, you can unlock Stefano’s full arsenal of winemaking tricks with the Nero Oro Riserva. Taken from his best vineyards and aged for 18 months in oak, it’s closer to a rich Amarone than its island home would suggest.

30,Pasqua 'PassioneSentimento' Passimento Rosso,"This is one of our most popular Italian reds. It’s fantastically plush and full of flavour – all thanks to the ‘appassimento’ style of winemaking. This means the grapes are picked at the peak of their ripeness and left to dry in special crates until they’ve lost 30% of their volume. It concentrates all the sugars and flavours in the grapes, making the texture seriously lush and velvety. With this intensity you won’t believe the price.

The wax seal you see on the label was a symbol of the extremely coveted designation. The old Bordeaux variety Carménère is used in the blend – and the end result is fit for a king.
