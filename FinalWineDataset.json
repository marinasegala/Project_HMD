They’ve been making Prosecco for three generations and wanted a name that tied them to the land which had given them so much. ‘Gioiosa’ – ‘joyful’ was the perfect fit. These lively bubbles are wonderfully refreshing with notes of white blossom, pear and peachy stone fruit. The perfect aperitif or party wine – and delicious with canapés.

Their much-loved signature cuvée, Le Black Label, was created in 1937 in honour of the house’s appointment as the official suppliers of the Royal Court of England. And now, with Le Black Création, winemaker Hervé Dantan has redefined it. Each Création is unique, made with the best grapes from over 100 crus and reserve wines dating back over a decade. And each blend carries its own number – in reference to the number of harvests that have taken place since Maison Lanson was founded in 1760. This, the 257th blend, predominantly uses wine from the 2017 Year, which produced Chardonnay with marked freshness, intensely fruity Pinot Noir, and notably supple Pinot Meunier. It's then aged for four years before release to dial up the complexity. You’ll find it rich yet elegant with ripe citrus and orchard-fruit flavours, plus notes of brioche and dried fruits.",

Primo’s winemaker, Alessandro Michelon, was the first outside of Veneto to adopt the method. He realised that Puglia’s sun-drenched, windswept vineyards offer an ideal climate for the process; once grapes are ripe, his team move through the vines, twisting the stem of every other bunch. This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine. Just like a Valpolicella, it’s big, plush and velvety, with ripe flavours of cherry, raspberry and redcurrant. A rich, meaty stew makes the perfect partner to its bold, fruity character.",

The estate lies in La Clape, an appellation famed for the quality of its reds. And that quality is certainly reflected in this, the château’s grand vin. It’s an expressive, full-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, which spends at least 10 months maturing in oak to give it extra complexity and a smooth, decadent texture.

Today, it’s the hub of a very different kind of pilgrimage – of wine lovers to one of the finest and most beautiful vineyards in all of Provence. Because the vineyards are at a higher altitude, there’s a perfect balance between warm daytime and cool nighttime temperatures to make the grapes incredibly aromatic. Perfect for rosé. It’s peachy and herbal – a heady distillation of the hills where it’s grown. With a wonderful citrusy edge, it’s really refreshing – but it’s also full bodied. Ideal with salty foods, like olives.",
